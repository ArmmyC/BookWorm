## About the Project

This project was created as part of the final requirement for the **CPE112** course. The game challenges players to form words using adjacent letters on a grid, similar to the original Bookworm game. We incorporated key computer science concepts into the game's logic and data handling.

### Features

- Classic Bookworm-style gameplay
- Word validation using an **AVL Tree**
- Word tracking and backtracking with a **Stack**
- Smooth MSI installer for easy setup (only for windows. Sorry!)
